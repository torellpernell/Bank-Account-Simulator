The Calculator CLI app provides users with a simple, command-line interface to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## User Stories

### Basic Operations
- As a user, I want to add two numbers, so that I can calculate their sum.
- As a user, I want to subtract one number from another, so that I can calculate the difference.

### Continuous Operations

## Functional Requirements
- The calculator must prompt the user for an operation (addition and subtraction).
- The calculator must prompt the user for two numbers to perform the operation on.
- The calculator must display the result of the operation.
- The calculator must handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric input).
